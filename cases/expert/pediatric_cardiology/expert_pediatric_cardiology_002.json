  "description": "A rare congenital cardiac anomaly where a finger-like protrusion of the left ventricular myocardium creates an arrhythmogenic focus. The diverticulum acts as an anatomical substrate for re-entrant ventricular arrhythmias, particularly during periods of increased sympathetic tone. Often misdiagnosed as benign PVCs until syncopal events occur.",
