  "specialty": "medical_genetics",

  "symptoms": [
    "progressive external ophthalmoplegia",

  "prognosis": "Poor without treatment, with progressive deterioration leading to death typically in 3rd-4th decade. Early diagnosis and treatment may improve outcomes.",
  "description": "MNGIE is an ultra-rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the TYMP gene leading to thymidine phosphorylase deficiency. This results in accumulation of toxic nucleosides that impair mitochondrial DNA replication, causing multi-system dysfunction particularly affecting the nervous system and gastrointestinal tract.",
