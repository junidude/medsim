  "description": "A rare congenital hand anomaly characterized by a thumb with three phalanges (instead of two) accompanied by preaxial (radial) polydactyly. This results from abnormal differentiation of the radial ray during embryonic development. The condition often requires complex reconstruction to create a functional, opposable thumb.",
