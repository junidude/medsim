  "description": "PSHS is a rare dysautonomic condition characterized by episodic sympathetic overactivity, often occurring after severe brain injury. The pathophysiology involves disruption of inhibitory pathways between the brainstem and spinal cord, leading to unopposed sympathetic outflow. Episodes can be triggered by noxious stimuli or occur spontaneously.",
