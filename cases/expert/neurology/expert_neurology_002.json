  "description": "A rare primary headache disorder combining features of paroxysmal hemicrania (indomethacin-responsive unilateral headache with autonomic features) and trigeminal neuralgia. The pathophysiology involves both trigeminovascular activation and trigeminal nerve hypersensitivity. Attacks are strictly unilateral, with pain maximal in the V1 distribution but radiating to V2/V3 territories.",
