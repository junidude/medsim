  "prognosis": "Guarded - mortality approaches 60% when combined with anastomotic failure. Survivors often require multiple reoperations and prolonged ICU care.",
  "description": "A life-threatening condition where increased intra-abdominal pressure (>20mmHg) causes multi-organ dysfunction following trauma or major abdominal surgery, complicated by breakdown of a surgical bowel connection. This creates a perfect storm of mechanical compression, systemic inflammation, and peritoneal contamination.",
