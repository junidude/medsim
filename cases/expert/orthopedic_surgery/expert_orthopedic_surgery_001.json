  "prognosis": "Guarded - depends on degree of deformity correction and tendon integrity restoration. Full return to high-impact activities unlikely without surgical intervention.",
  "description": "A complex congenital/acquired foot deformity combining dysplastic posterior tibial tendon anatomy with a symptomatic type II accessory navicular bone, leading to progressive adult-acquired flatfoot deformity. The dysplastic tendon fails to support the medial arch, while the accessory bone creates mechanical irritation.",
