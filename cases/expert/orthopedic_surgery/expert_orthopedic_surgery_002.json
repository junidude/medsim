    "Chronic medial ankle pain",

  "prognosis": "Guarded - depends on stage at diagnosis. Early intervention may prevent progression to rigid deformity but recurrence is common without strict adherence to postoperative protocols",
  "description": "A rare congenital variant combining dysplastic posterior tibial tendon fibers with fibrous subtalar coalition, leading to progressive adult-acquired flatfoot deformity. The dysplastic tendon fails to provide dynamic arch support while the coalition creates abnormal biomechanics, accelerating degenerative changes.",
