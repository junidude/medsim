  "description": "A rare form of adult intussusception where the sigmoid colon telescopes into the rectum, causing vascular compromise and early ischemic changes. Unlike pediatric cases, adult intussusception typically has a lead point (often neoplastic in origin). This variant involves the rectosigmoid junction specifically, creating diagnostic challenges as it may mimic diverticulitis or obstructing malignancy.",
