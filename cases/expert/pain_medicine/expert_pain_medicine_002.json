  "name": "Glossopharyngeal Neuralgia with Concurrent Eagle Syndrome",
  "specialty": "pain_medicine",
  "chief_complaint": "Severe, stabbing pain in my throat and ear, especially when swallowing or turning my head.",
  "symptoms": [
    "Sharp, electric-shock-like pain in throat",
    "Radiating pain to ear (otalgia)",
    "Triggered by swallowing, coughing, or head movement",
    "Occasional syncope during pain episodes",
    "Metallic taste in mouth"

  "physical_findings": [
    "Exquisitely tender styloid process on palpation",
    "Trigger point at tonsillar fossa",
    "Bradycardia during pain episodes (vagal response)",
    "No cranial nerve deficits on exam"

  "lab_results": {
    "CT scan": "Elongated styloid process (>3cm)",
    "MRI brain": "No vascular compression of cranial nerves IX/X",

  "treatment": [
