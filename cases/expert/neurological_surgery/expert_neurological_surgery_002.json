  "description": "A rare neurovascular disorder characterized by paroxysmal facial pain with prominent autonomic features, resulting from pathological interactions between trigeminal afferents and cranial parasympathetic outflow. Distinct from classical trigeminal neuralgia by its autonomic component and from cluster headache by its shorter attack duration and triggerability.",
