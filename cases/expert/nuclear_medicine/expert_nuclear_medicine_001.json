  "description": "An aggressive variant of differentiated thyroid cancer that has lost iodine avidity while maintaining thyroglobulin production, accompanied by rare paraneoplastic neurological manifestations. The condition demonstrates resistance to conventional radioiodine therapy and often presents with distant metastases. The paraneoplastic component suggests cross-reactivity between tumor antigens and cerebellar Purkinje cells.",
