  "description": "BARPE is a rare, idiopathic inflammatory condition affecting the retinal pigment epithelium. It presents with acute-onset bilateral visual disturbances, often following a viral illness. The pathophysiology involves transient dysfunction of the RPE pump mechanism, leading to fluid accumulation and photoreceptor disruption. Differential includes MEWDS, APMPPE, and syphilitic uveitis.",
