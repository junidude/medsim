  "description": "A rare autosomal recessive disorder of phosphate metabolism caused by mutations in FGF23, GALNT3, or KLOTHO genes. Characterized by ectopic calcifications in soft tissues and hyperphosphatemia due to renal phosphate wasting. Calcifications typically develop in periarticular regions and may cause severe functional impairment.",
