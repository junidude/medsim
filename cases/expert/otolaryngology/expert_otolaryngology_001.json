  "description": "ILNS is a recently characterized disorder involving hypersensitivity of the superior laryngeal nerve branches without identifiable structural pathology. Thought to represent a form of peripheral laryngeal neuropathy, it shares features with other functional neurologic disorders but with specific laryngeal localization. Diagnosis requires exclusion of other causes of chronic laryngeal symptoms.",
