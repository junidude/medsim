  "description": "CCRD is an ultra-rare autosomal recessive disorder of intestinal fat absorption caused by mutations in the SAR1B gene. It results in the inability to secrete chylomicrons from intestinal enterocytes, leading to fat malabsorption and failure to thrive. The condition presents in infancy and requires expert nutritional management.",
