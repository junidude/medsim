  "description": "A complex metabolic bone disorder characterized by renal phosphate wasting due to elevated FGF23, leading to osteomalacia. The condition is complicated by autonomous parathyroid hormone secretion (tertiary hyperparathyroidism) developing secondary to chronic hypocalcemia and vitamin D deficiency. This creates a challenging therapeutic paradox where treating the osteomalacia may exacerbate the hyperparathyroidism.",
