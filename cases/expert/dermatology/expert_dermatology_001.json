  "description": "EKVP is a rare genodermatosis characterized by two distinct features: (1) transient, migratory erythematous patches (erythrokeratodermia variabilis) and (2) fixed hyperkeratotic plaques (progressiva). It results from connexin gene mutations affecting gap junction function in keratinocytes. The condition typically presents in infancy or early childhood and shows autosomal dominant inheritance with complete penetrance but variable expressivity.",
