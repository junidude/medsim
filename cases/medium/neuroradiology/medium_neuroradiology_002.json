  "description": "Transient Global Amnesia (TGA) is a sudden, temporary episode of memory loss that can't be attributed to a more common neurological condition, such as epilepsy or stroke. During an episode of TGA, a person's recall of recent events simply vanishes, so they can't remember where they are or how they got there. In addition, the person may not remember anything about what's happening in the here and now. Consequently, they may repeat the same questions because they don't remember the answers they've just been given. The condition most often affects people in middle age and older.",
