  "symptoms": [
    "Pain in the palm when bending fingers",
    "Catching or locking sensation in the affected finger",
    "Weakness in grip strength"
  ],
  "physical_findings": [
    "Tenderness over the A2 pulley region",
    "Passive flexion greater than active flexion of the affected digit",
