  "symptoms": [
    "Postprandial abdominal pain (30-60 mins after eating)",
    "Unintentional weight loss (15% of body weight over 6 months)",
    "Food fear (avoidance of meals due to pain)",
    "Nausea without vomiting"

    "Fecal fat": "Elevated (steatorrhea)",
    "Albumin": "2.8 g/dL (low)",
    "CRP": "12 mg/L (elevated)"

  "treatment": [
    "Angioplasty with stenting of mesenteric arteries",
    "Parenteral nutrition during acute episodes",
    "Low-residue, high-calorie small frequent meals",
    "Antiplatelet therapy"
  ],
  "prognosis": "Guarded - depends on revascularization success. Untreated carries high mortality (50-80% at 2 years)",
  "description": "A rare vascular disorder where chronic insufficient blood flow to the intestines leads to ischemic damage. Unlike acute mesenteric ischemia, this develops gradually due to atherosclerotic narrowing of 2+ mesenteric arteries with inadequate collateral circulation. The intestinal mucosa becomes chronically hypoxic, impairing absorption and causing pain when metabolic demand increases during digestion.",
