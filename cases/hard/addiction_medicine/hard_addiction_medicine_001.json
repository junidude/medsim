  "symptoms": [
    "hyperthermia (39.2Â°C)",
    "generalized myoclonus",

  "description": "Life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonergic activity in CNS and peripheral serotonin receptors, exacerbated by recent discontinuation of chronic opioid use. Results from pharmacodynamic interaction between MDMA (serotonin releaser), fentanyl (weak SRI), and sertraline (SSRI) with abrupt opioid cessation removing inhibitory modulation of serotonin pathways.",
