  "name": "Polysubstance-Induced Serotonin Syndrome",
  "specialty": "addiction_medicine",
  "chief_complaint": "I feel like my body is on fire, my muscles won't stop twitching, and I can't think straight",
  "symptoms": [
    "Severe agitation",
    "Muscle rigidity",
    "Hyperthermia",
    "Confusion",
    "Diaphoresis"
  ],
  "physical_findings": [
    "Clonus (inducible/spontaneous)",
    "Hyperreflexia",
    "Tachycardia (HR 120-150)",
    "Blood pressure lability"
  ],
  "lab_results": {
    "CK": "Elevated (2000-5000 IU/L)",
    "WBC": "Leukocytosis (15-20 x10^9/L)",
    "Serotonin levels": "Markedly elevated",
    "Toxicology screen": "Positive for MDMA, tramadol, SSRI"
  },
  "treatment": [
    "Immediate discontinuation of serotonergic agents",
    "Aggressive IV hydration and cooling",
    "Benzodiazepines for agitation and muscle rigidity",
    "Cyproheptadine (serotonin antagonist)",
    "ICU monitoring for rhabdomyolysis/DIC"
  ],
  "prognosis": "Guarded - mortality 2-12% in severe cases. Full recovery possible with prompt treatment, but risk of residual cognitive effects",
  "description": "Life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonergic activity in CNS, typically from combination of serotonergic drugs (e.g., SSRIs + opioids + stimulants). Presents as a clinical triad of neuromuscular abnormalities, autonomic hyperactivity, and altered mental status.",
  "risk_factors": [
    "Polysubstance abuse",
