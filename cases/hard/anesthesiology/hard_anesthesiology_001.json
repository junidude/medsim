  "chief_complaint": "Muscle stiffness and high fever during surgery",
  "symptoms": [
    "Severe muscle rigidity",
    "Tachycardia",
    "Hyperthermia (rapid temperature rise)",
    "Dark-colored urine (myoglobinuria)"
  ],
  "physical_findings": [
    "Generalized muscle rigidity (especially jaw)",

    "Myoglobin": "Elevated in urine and serum"
  },
  "treatment": [
    "Immediate cessation of triggering agents (volatile anesthetics/succinylcholine)",
    "Rapid IV dantrolene sodium (2.5 mg/kg initially)",

  ],
  "prognosis": "Mortality <5% with prompt treatment, but risk of renal failure, DIC, or neurological damage if delayed",
