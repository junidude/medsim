  "name": "Radiation-Induced Brachial Plexopathy",
  "specialty": "radiation_oncology",
  "chief_complaint": "I have weakness and numbness in my arm that's getting worse, and it started after my radiation treatments.",
  "symptoms": [
    "progressive arm weakness",
    "numbness/tingling in hand/arm",
    "loss of fine motor control",
    "pain in shoulder/arm (burning or shooting)",
    "muscle wasting in affected arm"
  ],
  "physical_findings": [
    "diminished grip strength",
    "sensory deficit in C5-T1 dermatomes",
    "fasciculations in affected muscles",
    "absent deep tendon reflexes in affected arm"
  ],
  "lab_results": {
    "EMG": "evidence of denervation in brachial plexus distribution",
    "MRI": "fibrosis and atrophy of brachial plexus without tumor recurrence"
  },
  "treatment": [
    "physical therapy to maintain range of motion",
    "neuropathic pain medications (gabapentin, pregabalin)",
    "corticosteroids for acute inflammation",
    "surgical decompression in select cases",
    "transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)"
  ],
  "prognosis": "Variable; typically progressive with incomplete recovery. Early intervention may slow progression but complete reversal is uncommon. Quality of life can be maintained with proper symptom management.",
  "description": "A delayed complication of radiation therapy (typically appearing 6 months to several years post-treatment) characterized by progressive fibrosis and damage to the brachial plexus nerves. Most commonly occurs after radiation for breast cancer, lung cancer, or lymphoma. Pathophysiology involves a combination of direct nerve damage, vascular insufficiency, and fibrotic entrapment.",
  "risk_factors": [
    "radiation dose >60 Gy to plexus",
    "concurrent chemotherapy",
    "prior surgery in radiation field",
    "younger age at treatment",
    "presence of diabetes or vascular disease"
