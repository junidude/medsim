  "symptoms": [
    "Progressive arm weakness",
    "Tingling or numbness in fingers",
    "Shooting pain in shoulder/arm",
    "Loss of fine motor control"
  ],
  "physical_findings": [
    "Atrophy of intrinsic hand muscles",

  "treatment": [
    "Physical therapy to maintain range of motion",

  "prognosis": "Variable; some patients stabilize while others experience progressive deterioration. Complete recovery is uncommon due to neural fibrosis.",
  "description": "Delayed radiation injury to the brachial plexus occurring 6 months to several years after radiation therapy (typically for breast cancer or lymphoma).
