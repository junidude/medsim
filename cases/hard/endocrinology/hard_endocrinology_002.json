  "description": "A rare variant of primary hyperaldosteronism where excessive aldosterone secretion leads to paradoxical hypokalemia despite the hormone's typical potassium-sparing effects. The condition involves a complex dysregulation of renal sodium-potassium exchange channels and is often caused by bilateral adrenal hyperplasia or aldosterone-producing adenomas.",
