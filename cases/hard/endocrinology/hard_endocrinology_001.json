  "description": "A rare renal phosphate wasting disorder characterized by defective phosphate reabsorption in proximal tubules, leading to osteomalacia and paradoxical hypercalciuria. Often caused by FGF23-mediated phosphate wasting or intrinsic renal defects. Distinguished from other forms of hypophosphatemia by the presence of elevated 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels.",
