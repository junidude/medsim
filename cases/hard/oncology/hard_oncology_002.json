  "description": "A rare paraneoplastic syndrome where antibodies against aquaporin-4 (AQP4-IgG) cross-react with both neural tissue and occult malignancy, causing severe demyelination of optic nerves and spinal cord. Often associated with small cell lung cancer. Distinct from classic NMO by its rapid progression and poorer response to immunotherapy.",
