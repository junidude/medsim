  "prognosis": "With early diagnosis and treatment, metabolic complications can be managed, but lifelong therapy is typically required. Without treatment, severe obesity and metabolic complications develop.",
  "description": "CLRD is an extremely rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the LEPR gene, leading to leptin receptor dysfunction. This results in failure of satiety signaling, causing severe hyperphagia and early-onset obesity. The condition affects multiple endocrine axes including reproductive and growth hormones.",
