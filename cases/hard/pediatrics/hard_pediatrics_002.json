    "Severe hyperphagia (excessive hunger)",
    "Rapid weight gain in infancy",

    "Persistent fatigue"

  "treatment": [
    "Setmelanotide (MC4R agonist therapy)",
    "Strict dietary management",
    "Behavioral therapy for eating behaviors",
    "Hormone replacement at puberty",
    "Regular endocrine follow-up"
  ],
  "prognosis": "With early diagnosis and treatment, metabolic complications can be managed but lifelong therapy is required. Without treatment, severe obesity and metabolic syndrome develop.",
  "description": "CLRD is an ultra-rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the LEPR gene, leading to leptin receptor dysfunction. This results in failure of satiety signaling, severe early-onset obesity, and multiple endocrine abnormalities. The condition mimics simple obesity but has distinct genetic and metabolic features.",

    "Consanguineous parents",
