  "description": "A rare vascular disorder characterized by recurrent, transient vasospasm of mesenteric arterioles without underlying atherosclerotic disease. The pathophysiology involves abnormal smooth muscle reactivity in small mesenteric vessels, leading to episodic ischemia. Diagnosis requires exclusion of other mesenteric pathologies and demonstration of dynamic vasospasm on angiography.",
