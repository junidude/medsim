    "Progressive joint stiffness",
    "Localized swelling and warmth",
    "Pain with movement",
    "Decreased range of motion",
    "Palpable bony mass near joint"

  "prognosis": "Variable - early intervention can prevent progression but established HO often requires surgical management with risk of recurrence. Most cases stabilize within 6-12 months post-trauma.",
